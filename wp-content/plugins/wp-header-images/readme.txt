WP Header Images is a great plugin to implement custom header images for each page. You can set images easily and later can manage CSS from your theme.
WP Header Images is a WordPress plugin which helps you to choose a unique image for each menu page. Normally a menu item can be either page, post, category, product or even just a link. These menu items can be managed from WordPress Admin > Appearance > Menus. 
WooCommerce categories can have unique header images by using this plugin. It was a difficult thing to manage different slideshow before, most of the times you have to be restricted for banner area for only home page. And that home banners cannot be used for all pages. By this plugin you can use unique header images for each WooCommerce category and product pages too.
